# GraspingTask
This github as the aim to regroup all the codes that were used to make my 3 months' internship possible

The files added here are only to prepare the database and the model of classification.

First, the DATABASE.ino allows to send the force data of the fingers to publish a topic , the forcedatabase.py allows to subscribe to that topic to create the database on a csv file. Then, the forceclassification.py allows to create, train and export the modele for the neural network classification.
